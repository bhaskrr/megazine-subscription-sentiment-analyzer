They are the most well-regarded magazine out here in California, for gardeners, cooks and do it your-selfers.<br /><br />  Each issue offers a regional spotlight, offering travel, lodging and special interest activities. It's a great resource for anyone looking for perhaps a different area to visit.<br /><br />  The cooks section is always great and usually I can find at least 4 recipes to use in my kitchen each issue. Sunset also offers their recipe annuals, which have become treasured favorites in my kitchen. These hardbound books are a compilation of all Sunsets recipes. For those that love bread baking, Sunset offers some simply awesome bread recipes. All recipes are tested first in Sunsets' kitchens, before publication.<br /><br />  Sunsets garden section contains monthly tips and reminders for doing seasonal chores. The planting guides are a novice gardeners best friend. Every issue devotes itself to between two and three garden projects-offered step by step, and again-only after being tested in Sunsets own gardens.<br /><br />  Add to that the many great home design feature and projects, you get a magazine worth 3 times the amount they charge. If you've never tried Sunset magazine, I can honestly say you're in for a treat.\",\n          \"good price\",\n          \"I ordered this for my husband for valentines day...It's now April...no magazine : ((<br />Not very happy at all..but will wait one more month before I ask for my money back.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.4606353821848226,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          3.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They are the most well-regarded magazine out here in California, for gardeners, cooks and do it your-selfers.<br /><br />  Each issue offers a regional spotlight, offering travel, lodging and special interest activities. It's a great resource for anyone looking for perhaps a different area to visit.<br /><br />  The cooks section is always great and usually I can find at least 4 recipes to use in my kitchen each issue. Sunset also offers their recipe annuals, which have become treasured favorites in my kitchen. These hardbound books are a compilation of all Sunsets recipes. For those that love bread baking, Sunset offers some simply awesome bread recipes. All recipes are tested first in Sunsets' kitchens, before publication.<br /><br />  Sunsets garden section contains monthly tips and reminders for doing seasonal chores. The planting guides are a novice gardeners best friend. Every issue devotes itself to between two and three garden projects-offered step by step, and again-only after being tested in Sunsets own gardens.<br /><br />  Add to that the many great home design feature and projects, you get a magazine worth 3 times the amount they charge. If you've never tried Sunset magazine, I can honestly say you're in for a treat.\",\n          \"good price\",\n          \"I ordered this for my husband for valentines day...It's now April...no magazine : ((<br />Not very happy at all..but will wait one more month before I ask for my money back.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.4606353821848226,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          3.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
